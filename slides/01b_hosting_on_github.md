# Hosting on Github

## How hosting works

- Servers have needs
- Own/Rent/Services

> > Author Notes:

Although every computer on the internet can be a server, not all of them should be. A laptop would be a horrible server because any site hosted in it would go down every time you closed it. So a server needs to have:

- Constant power
- Fast connection
- Maintenance/updates

Most companies do not own their own servers because it takes a lot of very specialized knowledge to run and maintain servers. So they either rent servers to perform a variety of web functions or simply pay for specific apps or services like email, file storage, or http hosting.
